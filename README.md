# CSE-340---Project-4
The goal is to finish an incomplete parser and write a type checker for a given language. The input to the project will be a program and the output will 
be either error messages if there is a type mismatch or a success message if there is no type mismatch. 

Probably one of my most difficult of projects in C++.  Only partially finished it, since some parts are in complete and some bugs still need to be sorted out.  
Was able to get enough points to pass the class at the time.
